excerpt: "During the exam, they use a webcam to record themselves. An artificial intelligence algorithm will track their eye movement to determine where and what they are looking at, to deter cheating. After the exam, only the course instructor can review video recordings and the results of the proctoring or invigilating session and video segments."
