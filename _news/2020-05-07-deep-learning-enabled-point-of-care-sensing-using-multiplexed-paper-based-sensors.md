title: "Deep learning-enabled point-of-care sensing using multiplexed paper-based sensors"
excerpt: "We present a deep learning-based framework to design and quantify point-of-care sensors. As a use-case, we demonstrated a low-cost and rapid paper-based vertical flow assay (VFA) for high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) testing,"
