title: "Artificial intelligence joins the team for smarter & faster experiments"
excerpt: "Scientists have developed a new artificial intelligence method that automates experiments. It autonomously defines and conducts the next step of an experiment without input from human researchers. The method works by creating a model that fits the data from an experiment. It then uses that model as the starting point for a process of ..."

  - title: "Scientists tap into AI to put a new spin on neutron experiments"
    excerpt: "For the first time, a team at the US Department of Energy's (DOE's) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is using artificial intelligence (AI) to find patterns in neutron scattering data that can lead to an understanding of the physics inside quantum or complex magnetic materials. Led by Alan Tennant, Initiative Lead for Quantum Materials at ..."
