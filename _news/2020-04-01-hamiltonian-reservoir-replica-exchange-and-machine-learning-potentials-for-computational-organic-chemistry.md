title: "Hamiltonian-reservoir Replica Exchange and Machine Learning Potentials for Computational Organic Chemistry"
excerpt: "Find more information on the Altmetric Attention Score and how the score is calculated. This work combines a machine learning potential energy function with a modular enhanced sampling scheme to obtain statistically converged thermodynamical properties of flexible medium size organic molecules at high ab initio level. We offer a modular ..."
