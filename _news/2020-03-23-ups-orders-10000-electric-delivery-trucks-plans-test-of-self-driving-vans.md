title: "UPS orders 10,000 electric delivery trucks, plans test of self-driving vans"
excerpt: "The technology allows the company to test later pickups at UPS stores. The move comes after Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., in 2018 launched a pilot program in Atlanta to use a self-driving truck for deliveries to Googleâ€™s data center, with drivers in the cabs to monitor systems and take control if needed."
