title: "Virtual Video Device for Background Replacement with Deep Semantic Segmentation"
excerpt: "I looked like a medieval monk who had the top of his head chopped off, so ... next. I've heard good things about this deep learning stuff, so let's try that. I first had to find my way through a pile of frameworks (Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.), but after I found a ready-made model for semantic segmentation based on Tensorflow Lite (DeepLab ..."
