title: "Learning physical properties of liquid crystals with deep convolutional neural networks"
excerpt: "Machine learning algorithms have been available since the 1990s, but it is much more recently that they have come into use also in the physical sciences. While these algorithms have already proven to be useful in uncovering new properties of materials and in simplifying experimental protocols,"
