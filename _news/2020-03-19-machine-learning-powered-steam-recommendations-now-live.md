title: "Machine Learning-Powered Steam Recommendations Now Live"
excerpt: "Steam has added a new tool today for recommending games to users. Steam Interactive Recommender uses machine learning to predict which games you'll enjoy based on what other people with similar taste have played. The Interactive Recommender started as a tool within Steam Labs back in July 2019, but has now become a proper feature of the store."
