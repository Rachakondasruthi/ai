title: "New hardware could curb artificial intelligence’s energy appetite"
excerpt: "Quantum material could offset energy demand of artificial intelligence. To just solve a puzzle or play a game, artificial intelligence can require software running on thousands of computers. That could be the energy that three nuclear plants produce in one hour."

  - title: "How to curb the energy used by artificial intelligence"
    excerpt: "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become prevalent in electronics, but it requires vast amounts of energy in some cases. As such, researchers at Purdue University are developing hardware that can learn skills using a type of AI that currently runs on software platforms — an approach that could offset the energy needed for using AI in advanced applications such as self-driving cars or future drug discovery."
