title: "AI-powered redaction software speeds release of police video"
excerpt: "Officers can upload video to Veritoneâ€™s aiWARE platform, which uses CJIS-compliant Microsoft Azure, and use Redact. They run a head-detection engine against the video to quickly identify all the heads in the video, and then the officer can search and select which ones to redact and how to redact then, such as with a full blur or a pixilation."
