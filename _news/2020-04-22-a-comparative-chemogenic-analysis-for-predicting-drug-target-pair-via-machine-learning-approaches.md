title: "A comparative chemogenic analysis for predicting Drug-Target Pair via Machine Learning Approaches"
excerpt: "A computational technique for predicting the DTIs has now turned out to be an indispensable job during the process of drug finding. It tapers the exploration room for interactions by propounding possible interaction contenders for authentication through experiments of wet-lab which are known for their expensiveness and time consumption."
