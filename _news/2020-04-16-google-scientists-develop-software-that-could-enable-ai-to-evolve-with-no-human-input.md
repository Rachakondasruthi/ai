title: "Google Scientists Develop Software That Could Enable AI To Evolve With No Human Input"
excerpt: "But building and “training” these algorithms takes time, and can often ingrain human biases. To overcome these limitations, and enable further innovation in machine learning, researchers have explored the field of AutoML, whereby the machine learning process can be progressively automated, relying on machine compute time, rather than human ..."
