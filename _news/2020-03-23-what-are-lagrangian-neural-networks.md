title: "What Are Lagrangian Neural Networks"
excerpt: "So, a neural network that understands the conservation of energy just from data can have great implications for robotics and reinforcement learning. And, with LNNs, the authors have opened up new avenues of research by binding the underlying principles of nature with man-made artificial neural networks. Joseph-Louis Lagrange, born in 1736 ..."
