title: "Researchers say deep learning will power 5G and 6G ‘cognitive radios’"
excerpt: "That’s where deep learning comes in. The researchers hope to use machine learning techniques embedded within the wireless devices’ hardware to improve frequency utilization, such that the devices can develop AI-optimized spectrum usage strategies by themselves. Early studies suggest that deep learning models average 20% higher ..."
