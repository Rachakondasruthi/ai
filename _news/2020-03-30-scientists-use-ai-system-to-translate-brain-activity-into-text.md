title: "Scientists use AI system to translate brain activity into text"
excerpt: "A new AI system that converts brain activity into text could transform communication for people who can’t speak or type. The mind-reading machine uses brain implants to track what neurons do when someone speaks. An algorithm then converts the data into a string of numbers, which another system then translates into a sequence of words."

    excerpt: "Across the four women, the AI’s best performance was an average translation error rate of 3 per cent. Makin says that using a small number of sentences made it easier for the AI to learn which words tend to follow others. For example, the AI was able to decode that the word “Turner” was always likely to follow the word “Tina” in ..."
