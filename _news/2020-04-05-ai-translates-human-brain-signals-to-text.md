title: "AI Translates Human Brain Signals to Text"
excerpt: "Now scientists are one step closer towards a computer interface driven by human thoughts. Neuroscientists at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) published a study last week in Nature Neuroscience that shows how their brain-computer interface (BCI) is able to translate human brain activity into text with relatively high accuracy and at natural-speech rates using artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning."
