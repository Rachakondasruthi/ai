title: "Automatic diagnosis of the 12-lead ECG using a deep neural network"
excerpt: "Thus, a deep learning approach that allows for accurate interpretation of S12L-ECGs would have the greatest impact. The use of DNNs for S12L-ECG is still largely unexplored. A contributing factor for this is the shortage of full digital S12L-ECG databases, since most recordings are still registered only on paper, archived as images, or stored ..."
