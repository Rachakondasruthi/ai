title: "Energy-Saving AI Is Coming for Your Office Thermostat"
excerpt: "If the workers got too hot or too cold, they could tap an app to say so. The AI would adapt, creating microclimates to reflect their feedback. But in time, Spanos expected, the workers wouldn't bother. His goal is to make the system forgettable. Lights will turn on as workers come and go; screens will flicker to life as they settle at their desks."
