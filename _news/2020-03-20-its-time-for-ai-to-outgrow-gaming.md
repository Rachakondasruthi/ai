title: "It’s time for AI to outgrow gaming"
excerpt: "Any new reverence for an unbeatable AI, however, should be tempered by the fact that recreational games are very unusual. They take place in closed systems, where outcomes depend only on clearly defined actions and in some cases chance; they have obvious objectives; and they allow AI programs to learn from experience by running millions of matches."
