title: "Google and MIT come together to improve robot manipulation using computer vision transference"
excerpt: "The team used backbones or neural networks weights such as detecting corners, colors, and filtering edges used in computer vision models into affordance based models. This training was injected into a robot for it to learn to grasp objects through trial and error. In computer vision, deep model architecture consists of two parts--the backbone ..."
