title: "Pruning machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker Debugger and Amazon SageMaker Experiments"
excerpt: "In the past decade, deep learning has advanced many different areas, such as computer vision and natural language processing. State-of-the-art models now achieve near-human performance in tasks such as image classification. Deep neural networks can achieve this because they consist of millions of parameters"

    excerpt: "When running deep learning models in production, balancing infrastructure cost versus model latency is always an important consideration. At re:Invent 2018, AWS introduced Amazon SageMaker Neo and Amazon Elastic Inference, two services that can make models more efficient for deep learning. \nIn most deep"

  - title: "Three adjustments in calibrating models with neural networks"
    excerpt: "Because this process has to be repeated frequently and it is computationally expensive, more efficient solutions are in high demand. Artificial neural network (ANN) approaches, given their natural suitability to solve optimisation problems, are seen as a promising way of cutting some corners and delivering model parameters much quicker than ..."
