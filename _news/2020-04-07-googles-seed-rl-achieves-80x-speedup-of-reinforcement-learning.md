title: "Google's SEED RL Achieves 80x Speedup of Reinforcement-Learning"
excerpt: "Researchers at Google Brain recently open-sourced their Scalable, Efficient Deep-RL (SEED RL) algorithm for AI reinforcement-learning. SEED RL is a distributed architecture that achieves state-of-the-art results on several RL benchmarks at lower cost and up to 80x faster than previous systems. We believe SEED RL and the results presented ..."
