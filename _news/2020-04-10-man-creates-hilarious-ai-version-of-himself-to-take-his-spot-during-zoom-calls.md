title: "Man creates hilarious AI version of himself to take his spot during Zoom calls"
excerpt: "Well, sort of. Reed created an \"AI Digital Twin\" or a Zoombot if you will, and taught it speech recognition and text-to-speech conversation. Now, the fake version of himself is able to stand-in on Zoom calls and even respond to programed questions like \"How are you?\" and \"Did you get that?\" The only problem is it's very clear the Zoombot is a bot."
