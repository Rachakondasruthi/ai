title: "Cyborg computer chips will get their brain from human neurons"
excerpt: "A.I. has already gotten to almost sci-fi levels of emulating brain activity, so much so that amputees can experience mind-controlled robotic arms, and neural networks might soon be a thing. That still wasnâ€™t enough for the brains behind one ambitious startup, though. Cortical Labs sounds like it could have been pulled from the future."
