title: "Google researchers use deep reinforcement learning for optimizing chip design"
excerpt: "However, it is a process that takes substantial time, and efforts are being made to make it more efficient. Considering this, researchers working with Google have now looked towards machine learning to help tackle the problem. In a recent paper titled “Chip Placement with Deep Reinforcement Learning” published on arXiv, the team at Google ..."
