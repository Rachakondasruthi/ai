title: "Microsoft and Adaptive Biotechnologies partner to study immune response to COVID-19"
excerpt: "Researchers will sequence immune cell receptors from the samples using Adaptive’s proprietary technology. The findings will then be analyzed by Microsoft’s large-scale machine learning capabilities and Azure cloud platform. “We can improve our collective understanding of COVID-19 by decoding the immune system’s response to the virus and ..."

    excerpt: "Adaptive is using Microsoft Azure's machine learning capabilities to sift through data on the body's T-cell receptor sequences, which get generated in response to antigens in the blood. The machine learning process is used to refine a \"map\" of those sequences, which is done by \"matching trillions of T cells to the diseases they recognize,\" per ..."
