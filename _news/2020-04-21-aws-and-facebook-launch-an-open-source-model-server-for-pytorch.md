title: "AWS and Facebook launch an open-source model server for PyTorch"
excerpt: "For AWS, that’s mostly SageMaker, the company’s machine learning platform, but as Bratin Saha, AWS VP and GM for Machine Learning Services, told me, the work on PyTorch was mostly motivated by requests from the community. And while there are obviously other model servers like TensorFlow Serving and the Multi Model Server available today ..."

    excerpt: "Many services you interact with today rely on machine learning (ML). From online search and product recommendations to speech recognition and language translation, these services need ML models to serve predictions. As ML finds its way into even more services, you face the challenge of taking the results"
