title: "Deep learning-based decision support system for the diagnosis of neoplastic gallbladder polyps on ultrasonography: Preliminary results"
excerpt: "Ultrasonography (US) has been considered image of choice for gallbladder (GB) polyp, however, it had limitations in differentiating between nonneoplastic polyps and neoplastic polyps. We developed and investigated the usefulness of a deep learning-based decision support system (DL-DSS) for the differential diagnosis of GB polyps on US."
