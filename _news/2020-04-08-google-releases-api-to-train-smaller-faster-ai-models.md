title: "Google releases API to train smaller, faster AI models"
excerpt: "The QAT API solves this by simulating low-precision computation during the AI model training process. Quantization error is introduced as noise throughout the training, which QAT APIâ€™s algorithm tries to minimize such that it learns variables more robust to quantization. A training graph leverages operations that convert floating-point ..."
