title: "This Neural Net Can Detect Leaky Pipes in Mere Seconds"
excerpt: "Led by Jessica Bohorquez, a Ph.D. candidate at the university's School of Civil, Environmental, and Mining Engineering, the new work relies on an artificial neural network to identify topological elements of a pipe network, like junctions, to pinpoint and characterize leaks with near-pristine accuracy. The team published its research in the ..."
