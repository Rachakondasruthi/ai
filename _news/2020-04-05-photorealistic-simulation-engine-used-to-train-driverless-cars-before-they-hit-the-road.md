title: "Photorealistic Simulation Engine Used to Train Driverless Cars Before They Hit the Road"
excerpt: "A simulation system invented at MIT to train driverless cars creates a photorealistic world with infinite steering ... a PhD student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). â€œIn our simulation, however, control systems can experience those situations, learn for themselves to recover from them, and remain robust ..."
