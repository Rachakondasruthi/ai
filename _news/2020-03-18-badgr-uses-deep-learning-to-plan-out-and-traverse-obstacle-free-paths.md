title: "BADGR uses deep learning to plan out and traverse obstacle-free paths"
excerpt: "Projects and researches in the past have shown that deep learning is a potent technique for training robots to do specific things. To name a few, we've seen OpenAI use neural networks to train Dactyl to solve a Rubik's Cube, and an algorithm dubbed 6-DoF GraspNet that helps robots pick up arbitrary objects. Continuing the trend, researchers at ..."
