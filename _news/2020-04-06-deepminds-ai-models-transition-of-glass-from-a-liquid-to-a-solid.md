title: "DeepMind’s AI models transition of glass from a liquid to a solid"
excerpt: "In a paper published in the journal Nature Physics, DeepMind researchers describe an AI system that can predict the movement of glass molecules as they transition between liquid and solid states. The techniques and trained models, which have been made available in open source, could be used to predict other qualities of interest in glass ..."
