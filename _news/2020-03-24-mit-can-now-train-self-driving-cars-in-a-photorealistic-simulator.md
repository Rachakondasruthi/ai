title: "MIT can now train self-driving cars in a photorealistic simulator"
excerpt: "Simulators have been used for years to train human drivers, pilots and astronauts, and now they're being used to train self-driving cars too â€“ and a new system developed by researchers at MIT could be the most promising yet. The Virtual Image Synthesis and Transformation for Autonomy (VISTA) simulation system means cars don't have to venture ..."
