title: "DeepMind’s new AI can beat humans at 57 Atari games"
excerpt: "Google subsidiary DeepMind has unveiled an AI called Agent57 that can beat the average human at 57 classic Atari games. The system achieved this feat using deep reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique that helps an AI improve its decisions by trying out different approaches and learning from its mistakes. DeepMind used the same ..."
