title: "Easing the development of visual SLAM applications"
excerpt: "This article describes the basic visual SLAM process, covering the modules and the algorithms involved in object recognition and tracking and error correction. The advantages of offloading the SLAM computation and functionality to dedicated DSPs are discussed and the CEVA-SLAM SDK development kit is used as an illustration of the benefits that ..."

  - title: "Hyperalignment of motor cortical areas based on motor imagery during action observation"
    excerpt: "Recent work by Haxby et al. (2011) introduced a method called Hyperalignment that explored neural activity in ventral temporal cortex during object recognition and demonstrated the ability to align individual patterns of brain activity into a common high dimensional space to facilitate Between Subject Classification (BSC). Here we examined BSC ..."
