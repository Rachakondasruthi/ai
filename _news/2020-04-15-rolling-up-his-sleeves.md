title: "Rolling up his sleeves"
excerpt: "For my masterâ€™s thesis, I worked on speech recognition, informed by linguistic models. For my PhD, I worked in computer vision and object recognition. I was always interested, and still am, in how machines can perceive the world around them directly. A big part of the culture of the AI Lab when I was there was to do really bold things."
