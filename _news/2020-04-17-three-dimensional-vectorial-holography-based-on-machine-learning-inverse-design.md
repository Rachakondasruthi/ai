title: "Three-dimensional vectorial holography based on machine learning inverse design"
excerpt: "We demonstrate 3D vectorial holography where an arbitrary 3D vectorial field distribution on a wavefront can be precisely reconstructed using the machine learning inverse design based on multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks. This 3D vectorial holography allows the lensless reconstruction of a 3D vectorial holographic image with an ..."
