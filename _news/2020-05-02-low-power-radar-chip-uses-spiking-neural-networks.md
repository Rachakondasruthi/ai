title: "Low-power radar chip uses spiking neural networks"
excerpt: "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have already been established in a wide range of application domains. They are a key ingredient, for instance, of the radar-based anti-collision systems commonly used in the automotive industry. But ANNs come with limitations. For one, they consume too much power to be integrated into increasingly constrained ..."
