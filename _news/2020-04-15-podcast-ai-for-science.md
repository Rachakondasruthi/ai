excerpt: "In this podcast, the Radio Free HPC team looks at the AI for Science program coming out of Argonne National Laboratory ... Hackers have stolen and ransomed AMD’s GPU test files, a dastardly act, but not surprising to see. They’re looking for $100 million to give the files back, while AMD has downplayed their importance and value."
