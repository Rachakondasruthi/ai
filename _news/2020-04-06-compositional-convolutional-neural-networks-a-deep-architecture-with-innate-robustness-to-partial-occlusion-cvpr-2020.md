title: "Compositional Convolutional Neural Networks: A Deep Architecture with Innate Robustness to Partial Occlusion [CVPR-2020]"
excerpt: "This is a port of our original code from Tensorflow to PyTorch. The code is a lot faster and cleaner compared to the original code base. The results are a little different from the ones reported in the paper. In particular, the performance is a little lower for low occlusion and higher for stronger occlusion. On average the results are slightly ..."
