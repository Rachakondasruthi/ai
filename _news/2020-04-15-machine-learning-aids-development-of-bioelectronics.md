title: "Machine learning aids development of bioelectronics"
excerpt: "Researchers from the University of Chicago have used machine learning to develop electronic devices that are compatible with human bodies. A family of self-assembling peptides known as Ï€-conjugated oligopeptides promises to be the basis for the next generation of electronic biocompatible materials. But testing these materials has been difficult."
