title: "Washington Governor Signed Landmark Facial Recognition Law"
excerpt: "Washington Governor Jay Inslee has recently signed landmark facial recognition legislation. This initiative is going to be the first US state law that ultimately limits the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement. On the contrary, the civil rights activists said the measure did not go far enough to protect marginalised groups."
