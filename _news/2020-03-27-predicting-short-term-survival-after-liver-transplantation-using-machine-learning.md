title: "Predicting Short-term Survival after Liver Transplantation using Machine Learning"
excerpt: "Liver transplantation is one of the most effective treatments for end-stage liver disease, but the demand for livers is much higher than the available donor livers. Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is a commonly used approach to prioritize patients,"

  - title: "Practical Deep-Learning Representation for Fast Heterogeneous Catalyst Screening"
    excerpt: "Recently, comprehensive binding energy prediction machine-learning models have been demonstrated and promise to accelerate the catalyst screening. Here, we present a simple and versatile representation, applicable to any deep-learning models, to further accelerate such process. Our approach involves labeling the binding site atoms of the ..."
