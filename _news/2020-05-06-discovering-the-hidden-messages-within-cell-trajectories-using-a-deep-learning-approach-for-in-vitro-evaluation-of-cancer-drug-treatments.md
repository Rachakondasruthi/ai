title: "Discovering the hidden messages within cell trajectories using a deep learning approach for in vitro evaluation of cancer drug treatments"
excerpt: "We describe a novel method to achieve a universal, massive, and fully automated analysis of cell motility behaviours, starting from time-lapse microscopy images. The approach was inspired by the recent successes in application of machine learning for style recognition in paintings and artistic style transfer."
