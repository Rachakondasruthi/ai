title: "Machine-learning informed prediction of high-entropy solid solution formation: Beyond the Hume-Rothery rules"
excerpt: "The empirical rules for the prediction of solid solution formation proposed so far in the literature usually have very compromised predictability. Some rules with seemingly good predictability were, however,"
