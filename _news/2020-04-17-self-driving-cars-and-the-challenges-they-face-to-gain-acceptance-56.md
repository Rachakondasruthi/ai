title: "Self-driving cars and the challenges they face to gain acceptance (5/6)"
excerpt: "Road etiquette will have a significant influence on the kinds of decisions that self-driving cars make. City driving often requires a degree of assertiveness than would not be normal when on rural roads. It frequently involves manoeuvres – such as merging into a busy lane – that to an autonomous vehicle may appear too risky to undertake."
