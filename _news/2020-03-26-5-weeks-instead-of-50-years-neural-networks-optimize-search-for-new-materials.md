title: "5 Weeks Instead of 50 Years: Neural Networks Optimize Search for New Materials"
excerpt: "He says this research addresses “how to do machine learning when there are multiple objectives. Kulik’s approach uses leading-edge methods to train an artificial neural network that is used to predict which combination of transition metal ions and organic ligands will be best for redox flow battery electrolytes.” Schatz says “this ..."
