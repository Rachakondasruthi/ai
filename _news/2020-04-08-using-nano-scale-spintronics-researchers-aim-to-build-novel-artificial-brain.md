title: "Using nano-scale spintronics, researchers aim to build novel artificial brain"
excerpt: "New research project to develop AI hardware; a completely new kind of computer system that mimics how the human brain is built up. Out with CPUs and memory storage, and in with artificial neural networks that can increase computer performance by up to 100,000 times compared to modern supercomputers. Researchers from Aarhus University have just ..."
