title: "MIT’s deep learning found an antibiotic for a germ nothing else could kill"
excerpt: "Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard last month described in the scholarly journal Cell how they used a deep learning neural network to identify a molecular compound that's different from most antibiotics. They showed that when the compound is injected in mice, it fights bacteria that no existing drug can eliminate."
