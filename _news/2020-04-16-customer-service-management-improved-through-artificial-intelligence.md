title: "Customer Service Management Improved Through Artificial Intelligence"
excerpt: "Machine learning is still fairly technical, especially machine learning (ML), and the early audience had to be able to handle the detail. Now natural language processing (NLP) and generation (NLG), are starting to mesh with machine learning to provide an interface than can help the non-technical audience. The ML side has its own complexity."
