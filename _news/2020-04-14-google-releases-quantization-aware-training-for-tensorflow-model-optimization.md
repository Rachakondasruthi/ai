title: "Google Releases Quantization Aware Training for TensorFlow Model Optimization"
excerpt: "Google announced the release of the Quantization Aware Training (QAT) API for their TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit. QAT simulates low-precision hardware during the neural-network training process, adding the quantization error into the overall network loss metric, which causes the training process to minimize the effects of post-training ..."
