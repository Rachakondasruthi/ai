title: "Deep learning robotic guidance for autonomous vascular access"
excerpt: "In the current device, robot trajectories are updated according to the vessel pose computed from deep neural network predictions. However, rather than using deep learning to control robot motions in an end-to-end manner, trajectories are determined from the robot kinematic parameters based on set control policies. It is possible, however ..."
