    excerpt: "The idea of reinforcement learning—or learning based on reward—has been around for so long it’s easy to forget we don’t really know how it works. If DeepMind’s new bombshell paper in Nature is any indication, a common approach in AI, one that’s led to humanity’s defeat in the game of Go against machines, may have the answer."
