  - title: "Predicting chaos using aerosols and AI"
    excerpt: "This kind of AI is first fed information about a real-world process, then, based on that data, it creates a simulation of that process. Motivated by game theory, a generative adversarial network receives both the ground truth (real) and randomly generated data (fake) and tries to determine which is real and which is fake. This process repeats ..."
