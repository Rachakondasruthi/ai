excerpt: "The hard drive, stored in the trunk and housing the vehicle’s artificial intelligence and perception software ... GM submitted a petition for permission to deploy a fully driverless Chevy Bolt in 2018, but it has yet to receive a response. And it will most likely need another exemption before the Origin is allowed to hit the road, too."
