    excerpt: "Since then, deep learning has powered its way through a series of benchmarks. In the field of natural language processing (NLP), the team behind the GLUE benchmark suite has produced a more stringent version called SuperGLUE because systems that have adopted a second layer of deep learning were so successful at beating the original."
