title: "COMT-Polymorphisms Modulated Functional Profile of the Fusiform Face Area Contributes to Face-Specific Recognition Ability"
excerpt: "Previous studies have shown that face-specific recognition ability (FRA) is heritable; however, the neural basis of this heritability is unclear. Candidate gene studies have suggested that the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) rs4680 polymorphism is related to face perception. Here, using a partial least squares (PLS) method, we examined the ..."
