    excerpt: "What the Russian researchers did is they replaced the experts with artificial intelligence. They trained the machine to distinguish between networks and tell if a given network will deliver quantum advantage. This pinpoints the networks that are good candidates for building a quantum computer. The team used a neural network geared toward image ..."

  - title: "AI method determines quantum advantage for advanced computing"
    excerpt: "Classical computations, by contrast, tend to return only bulky approximate solutions. What the Russian researchers did is train an AI model to distinguish between networks and determine if a given network have a quantum advantage. This pinpoints the networks that are good candidates for building a quantum computer. The team used a neural ..."
