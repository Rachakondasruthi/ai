title: "How Do Deep Networks of AI Learn?"
excerpt: "A mathematical framework for how neural networks operate will provide clear benefits not just to machine learning researchers, who can use it to decide precisely how much data to use or what parameters to set for the best performance, but also to neuroscientists, who hope that the inner workings of artificial networks will shed light on how ..."
