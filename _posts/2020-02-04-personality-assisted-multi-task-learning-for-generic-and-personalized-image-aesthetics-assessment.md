title: "Personality-Assisted Multi-Task Learning for Generic and Personalized Image Aesthetics Assessment"
excerpt: "As an important subjective trait, personality is believed to be a key factor in modeling individual’s subjective preference. In this paper, we present a personality-assisted multi-task deep learning framework for both generic and personalized image aesthetics assessment. The proposed framework comprises two stages. In the first stage ..."

  - title: "New Algorithm Could Enable Personalized Treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema"
    excerpt: "The algorithm could also be adapted to predict therapy response for many other eye diseases, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The team’s algorithm is based on an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, a kind of artificial intelligence with the ability to investigate images by giving importance to a ..."
