title: "AI-analyzed blood test can predict the progression of neurodegenerative disease"
excerpt: "A new study shows artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of blood samples can predict and explain disease progression, which could one day help doctors choose more appropriate and effective treatments for patients. Evaluating the effectiveness of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases is often difficult because each patient's progression is ..."
