title: "Secrets of nanospiral formation revealed by machine learning"
excerpt: "The teamâ€™s study combined new advanced imaging techniques with machine learning and their findings could lead to fast and scalable techniques for manufacturing light-controlling metamaterials. As molten metal alloys cool, solid structures begin to form internally as small atomic clusters crystallize. By fine-tuning the cooling conditions ..."
