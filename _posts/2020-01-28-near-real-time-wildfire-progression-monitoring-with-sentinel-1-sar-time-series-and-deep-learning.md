title: "Near Real-Time Wildfire Progression Monitoring with Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series and Deep Learning"
excerpt: "In this communication, we investigated and demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR time series with a deep learning framework for near real-time wildfire progression monitoring. The deep learning framework, based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is developed to detect burnt areas automatically using every new SAR image acquired ..."
