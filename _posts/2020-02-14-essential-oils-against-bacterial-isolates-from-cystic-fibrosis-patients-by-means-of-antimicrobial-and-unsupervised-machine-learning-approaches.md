title: "Essential oils against bacterial isolates from cystic fibrosis patients by means of antimicrobial and unsupervised machine learning approaches"
excerpt: "Full size table To reduce the in vitro procedure and to render the investigation as convergent as possible the following workflow was followed. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms and techniques, as implemented in python language 13, were firstly applied to pick-up a fewer number of representative strains (RS) among the panel of 40."
