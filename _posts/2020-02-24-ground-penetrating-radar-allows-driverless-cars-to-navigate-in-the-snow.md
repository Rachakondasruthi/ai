title: "Ground penetrating radar allows driverless cars to navigate in the snow"
excerpt: "Researchers are testing ground penetrating radar (GPR) in driverless cars in order to allow them to navigate through snowy conditions and inclement weather. A team from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) said the technology allows the cars to “see” what is underneath the snow so that the driverless systems do not ..."

    excerpt: "Plus, bad weather has a tendency to obscure road signage and structures that normally serve as navigational landmarks. Fortunately, researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Lincoln Laboratory are on the case. In a paper that will be published in the journal IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters later ..."
