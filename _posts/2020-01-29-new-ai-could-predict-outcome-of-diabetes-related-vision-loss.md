title: "New AI could predict outcome of diabetes-related vision loss"
excerpt: "In a new study, researchers found that using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze retinal images could one day help doctors ... Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are widely used as the first line of therapy for diabetic macular edema, but they don’t work for everyone. There’s a need to identify who would benefit ..."
