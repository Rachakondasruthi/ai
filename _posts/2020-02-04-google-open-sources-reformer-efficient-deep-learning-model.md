title: "Google Open-Sources Reformer Efficient Deep-Learning Model"
excerpt: "Researchers from Google AI recently open-sourced the Reformer, a more efficient version of the Transformer deep-learning model. Using a hashing trick for attention calculation and reversible residual layers, the Reformer can handle text sequences up to 1 million words while consuming only 16GB of memory on a single GPU accelerator. With such a ..."

  - title: "Google open-sources LaserTagger, an AI model that speeds up text generation"
    excerpt: "Sequence-to-sequence AI models, which were introduced by Google in 2014, aim to map fixed-length input (usually text) with a fixed-length output where the length of the input and output might differ. Theyâ€™re used in text-generating tasks including summarization, grammatical error correction, and sentence fusion, and recent architectural ..."
