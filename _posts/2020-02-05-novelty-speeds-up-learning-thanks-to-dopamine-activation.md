title: "Novelty speeds up learning thanks to dopamine activation"
excerpt: "Novelty directly activates the dopamine system, which is responsible for associative learning. The findings have implications for improving learning strategies and for the design of machine learning algorithms. A fundamental type of learning, known as associative learning, is commonly observed in animals and humans. It involves the association ..."

  - title: "Machine learning technique speeds up crystal structure determination"
    excerpt: "The method uses a machine learning algorithm, similar to the type used in facial recognition and self-driving cars, to independently analyze electron diffraction patterns, and do so with at least 95% accuracy. However, the drawback of commercial EBSD systems is the software's inability to determine the atomic structure of the crystalline ..."

  - title: "Crystal symmetry determination in electron diffraction using machine learning"
    excerpt: "Automated phase identification is the first step in making EBSD into a high-throughput technique. We used a machine learningâ€“based approach and developed a general methodology for rapid and autonomous identification of the crystal symmetry from EBSD patterns. We evaluated our algorithm with diffraction patterns from materials outside the ..."

  - title: "Machine learning automates identification of crystal structures in new materials"
    excerpt: "Providing a method for eliminating some of the guesswork from crystal structure determination, a machine learning-based approach to determining crystal symmetry and structure from unknown samples may greatly improve the speed and accuracy of this process. The new method brings crystallography into the high-throughput world of artificial ..."
