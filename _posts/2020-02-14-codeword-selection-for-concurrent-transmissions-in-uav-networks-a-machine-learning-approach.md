title: "Codeword Selection for Concurrent Transmissions in UAV Networks: A Machine Learning Approach"
excerpt: "Fortunately, machine learning (ML) is suitable for decreasing complexity in codeword selection, because ML could extract features from the data samples acquired in real environments. In this paper, we propose an ML approach to achieve an efficient and low complexity codeword selection for UAV networks. Specifically, we first derive the ..."

  - title: "Learning Invariant Representations From EEG via Adversarial Inference"
    excerpt: "While deep neural networks are recently emerging as generic EEG feature extractors, this transfer learning aspect usually relies on the prior assumption that deep networks naturally behave as subject- (or session-) invariant EEG feature extractors. We propose a further step towards invariance of EEG deep learning frameworks in a systemic way ..."
