title: "Machine Learning and Bioinformatics Models to Identify Pathways that Mediate Influences of Welding Fumes on Cancer Progression"
excerpt: "This approach is efficient for learning the effect of a specific gene of interest on patient survival in the presence of the clinical factors. A protein-protein interaction network refers to the binding of proteins in the cell formed by biochemical or complex biological functions. Protein-protein interactions are essential to understand the ..."
