title: "Rice University Engineers Develop Deep Learning Computer That Accurately Forecasts Heat Waves, Cold Spells"
excerpt: "HOUSTON, Feb. 4, 2020 — Rice University engineers have created a deep learning computer system that taught itself to accurately predict extreme weather events, like heat waves, up to five days in advance using minimal information about current weather conditions. Ironically, Rice’s self-learning “capsule neural network” uses an analog ..."
