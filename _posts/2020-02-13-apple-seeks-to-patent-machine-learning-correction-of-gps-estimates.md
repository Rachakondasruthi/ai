title: "Apple seeks to patent machine learning correction of GPS estimates"
excerpt: "But Apple thinks it can improve location accuracy by applying machine learning to Kalman estimation filters, a just-published patent application reveals. The basic concept is that while navigation systems generally rely on live location-determining pings from multiple satellites â€” a process that can take precious time, during which the ..."

  - title: "Machine learning could help Apple Maps fix bogus GPS coordinates"
    excerpt: "In the patent application published on Thursday by the US Patent and Trademark Office, Apple has come up with \"Machine learning-assisted satellite-based positioning.\" In short, it is a way to analyze GPS data by comparing it against data acquired by a machine-learning model. The idea is that the device receives its estimated position based on a ..."
