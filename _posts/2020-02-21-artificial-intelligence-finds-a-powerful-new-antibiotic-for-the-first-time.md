title: "Artificial Intelligence Finds A Powerful New Antibiotic For The First Time"
excerpt: "Artificial intelligence (AI) has proved to be a useful ally in the battle against antibiotic resistance. A powerful antibiotic that’s even able to kill superbugs has been discovered thanks to a machine-learning algorithm Researchers from MIT used a novel computer algorithm to sift through a vast digital archive of over 100 million chemical ..."
