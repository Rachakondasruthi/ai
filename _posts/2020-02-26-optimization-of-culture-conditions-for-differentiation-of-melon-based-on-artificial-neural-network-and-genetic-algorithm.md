title: "Optimization of culture conditions for differentiation of melon based on artificial neural network and genetic algorithm"
excerpt: "Artificial neural network is an efficient and accurate fitting method. It has the function of self-learning, which is particularly important for prediction, and it could take advantage of the computerâ€™s high-speed computing capabilities and find the optimal solution quickly. In this paper, four culture conditions: agar concentration ..."
