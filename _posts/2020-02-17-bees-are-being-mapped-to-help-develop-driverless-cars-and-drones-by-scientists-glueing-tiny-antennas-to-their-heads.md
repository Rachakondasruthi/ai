title: "Bees are being mapped to help develop driverless cars and drones by scientists glueing tiny antennas to their heads"
excerpt: "“So it makes sense to me that we should try and mimic a bee brain in drones and driverless cars. “It is just more practical than trying ... By reverse engineering the brains of honeybees they hope to design a new kind of artificial intelligence which is based on natural neural processes rather than machine learning."

    excerpt: "Bee brains could hold the secrets to future autonomous technology (Photo: Yuri KADOBNOV / AFP) (Photo credit should read YURI KADOBNOV/AFP via Getty Images) Honeybee brains may only be the size of a pinhead but they can travel for five miles and still manage to find their way home. Now, scientists are looking to mimic the working of that ..."
