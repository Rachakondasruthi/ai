title: "Distinct sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation supports brain asymmetry for speech and melody"
excerpt: "Degradation of temporal information impaired speech recognition but not melody recognition, whereas degradation of spectral information impaired melody recognition but not speech recognition. Brain scanning revealed a right-left asymmetry for speech and music. Classification of speech content occurred exclusively in the left auditory cortex ..."
