title: "Bumble Bees Can Recognize Objects Across Senses"
excerpt: "This ability to experience an object in one sensory modality and later recognize it in another is called cross-modal object recognition. It’s actually a highly complex cognitive capacity that was thought to be limited to vertebrates. Cross-modal object recognition has been demonstrated across vision and touch in humans, apes, monkeys ..."

  - title: "When bees can’t see, the humble bumble can make do with a fumble"
    excerpt: "Results show that bumblebees are able to successfully recognise objects in both directions, sight-to-touch and touch-to-sight. Cross-modal object recognition has been shown in primates, rats, dolphins and electric fish. Like humans, bumblebees have been found to recognise objects in the dark using their sense of touch. Scientists have ..."

  - title: "Bumble bees display cross-modal object recognition between visual and tactile senses"
    excerpt: "For example, an object out of view, but for which we have a mental image, can still be recognized by touch. Such cross-modal recognition is highly adaptive and has been recently identified in other mammals, but whether it is widespread has been debated. Solvi et al. tested for this behavior in bumble bees, which are increasingly recognized as ..."

  - title: "Cross-modal sensory transfer: Bumble bees do it"
    excerpt: "Cross-modal recognition is also useful for increasing the flexibility of object-recognition systems. The finding by Solvi et al. illustrates that tiny invertebrates, with brain structures that differ greatly from those of vertebrates, also can experience an object with one sensory modality and later recognize that same object with a different ..."
