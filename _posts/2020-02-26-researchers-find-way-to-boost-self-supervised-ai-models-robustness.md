title: "Researchers find way to boost self-supervised AI models’ robustness"
excerpt: "In self-supervised learning, an AI technique where the training data is automatically labeled by a feature extractor, the said extractor not uncommonly exploits low-level features (known as “shortcuts”) that cause it to ignore useful representations. In search of a technique that might help to remove those shortcuts autonomously ..."
