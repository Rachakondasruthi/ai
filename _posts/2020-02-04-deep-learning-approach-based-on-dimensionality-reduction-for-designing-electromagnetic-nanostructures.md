title: "Deep learning approach based on dimensionality reduction for designing electromagnetic nanostructures"
excerpt: "In this paper, we demonstrate a computationally efficient new approach based on deep learning (DL) techniques for analysis, design and optimization of electromagnetic (EM) nanostructures. We use the strong correlation among features of a generic EM problem to considerably reduce the dimensionality of the problem and thus, the computational ..."

    excerpt: "We established a rapid diagnostic system based on the combination of probe electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (PESI-MS) and machine learning without the aid of immunohistological and biochemical procedures to identify tumour areas with heterogeneous TGF-β signalling status in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A total of 240 ..."
