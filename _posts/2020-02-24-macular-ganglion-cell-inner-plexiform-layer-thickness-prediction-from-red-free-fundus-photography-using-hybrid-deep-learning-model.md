title: "Macular Ganglion Cell-Inner Plexiform Layer Thickness Prediction from Red-free Fundus Photography using Hybrid Deep Learning Model"
excerpt: "There has been remarkable progress in glaucoma screening thanks to the development of deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual recognition 4,5,6. A number of studies have reported the diagnostic performance of the deep learning model as excellent in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic ..."
