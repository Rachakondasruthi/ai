title: "Using deep-learning to forecast the magnitude and characteristics of urban heat island in Seoul Korea"
excerpt: "To understand the magnitude and characteristics of UHI in Seoul and to accommodate for the high temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of the UHI which make it inherently challenging to analyze using conventional statistical methods, we developed two deep learning models, a temporal UHI-model and a spatial UHI model, using a feed ..."
