title: "Soft Error Resilience of Deep Residual Networks for Object Recognition"
excerpt: "Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have truly gained attention in object recognition and object classification in particular. When being implemented on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), deeper networks are more accurate than shallow ones. Residual Networks (ResNets) are one of the deepest CNN architectures used in various fields ..."

    excerpt: "In daily usage, users should be able to recognize objects through mere bottom-up processing. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies demonstrating bottom-up object recognition using tactile SSD which we would predict to yield worse recognition performance than those reported in the literature so far."
