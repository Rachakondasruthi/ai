  - title: "Classic 1896 short film gets upscaled to 4K using neural networks"
    excerpt: "One of the most famous short films in cinema is an 1896 ... 4K, brought its frame rate up to 60fps, and even added sound. The effect is impressive, turning a movie that’s over 120 years old into something that seems like it could have been filmed today (via Digg). Denis Shiryaev, who did the upscaling, said he used several neural networks to ..."

    excerpt: "A wild thought, given the blurry, low-resolution quality of the original film. Thankfully those panicky cinephile pioneers never saw the AI-enhanced upscaled version released by Denis Shiryaev, or they would have absolutely flipped their lids. Shiryaev leveraged a pair of publically available enhancement programs, DAIN and Topaz Labs' Gigapixel ..."

    excerpt: "As the name implies, neural networks are networks of artificial neurons—mathematical functions that transform a set of input values into an output value. The key feature of neural networks is that they can be trained: if you have a bunch of example inputs whose \"correct\" outputs are known, you can tune the parameters of the network to make it ..."
