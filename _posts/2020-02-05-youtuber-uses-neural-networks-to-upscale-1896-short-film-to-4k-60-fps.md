    excerpt: "As the name implies, neural networks are networks of artificial neuronsâ€”mathematical functions that transform a set of input values into an output value. The key feature of neural networks is that they can be trained: if you have a bunch of example inputs whose \"correct\" outputs are known, you can tune the parameters of the network to make it ..."
