title: "Impact of the Sub-Resting Membrane Potential on Accurate Inference in Spiking Neural Networks"
excerpt: "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered as the third generation of artificial neural networks, having the potential to improve the energy efficiency of conventional computing systems. Although the firing rate of a spiking neuron is an approximation of rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation in an analog-valued neural network (ANN), there ..."
