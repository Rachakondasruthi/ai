    excerpt: "Data labeling is an arduous — but necessary — part of the AI model training process. Currently, it takes around 200-500 samples of annotated images for a model to learn to detect a single object. Fortunately, freely available tools help automate the most monotonous sub-tasks, and one of these was recently published by IBM on GitHub."
