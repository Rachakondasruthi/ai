title: "Artificial intelligence trained to find disease-related genes"
excerpt: "Researchers have developed an artificial neural network using deep learning to identify genes that are related to disease. An artificial neural network has revealed patterns in huge amounts of gene expression data and discovered groups of disease-related genes. The developers, from Linköping University, Sweden, hope that the method can ..."
