title: "Assessing cardiovascular risks from a mid-thigh CT image: a tree-based machine learning approach using radiodensitometric distributions"
excerpt: "3. Table 4 The 11 nonlinear trimodal regression analysis parameters were used to assess cardiovascular risks through machine learning algorithms. The evaluation metrics by cardiac pathophysiology were computed. Regarding the ML analyses, CHF was classified with the highest overall scores; specifically, the RF method yielded the best results ..."
