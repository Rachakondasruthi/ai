  - title: "ARM’s new edge AI chips promise IoT devices that won’t need the cloud"
    excerpt: "Edge AI is one of the biggest trends in chip technology. These are chips that run AI processing on the edge — or, in other words, on a device without a cloud connection. Apple recently bought a company that specializes in it, Google’s Coral initiative is meant to make it easier, and chipmaker ARM has already been working on it for years."
