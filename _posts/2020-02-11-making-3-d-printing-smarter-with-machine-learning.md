  - title: "Deep Learning with Spiking Networks: Optimising Energy Consumption"
    excerpt: "There are several important differences between what is nowadays known as a “neural network” (in the deep learning sense) and networks of neurons in the brain. A particularly evident one is that artificial networks have analogue activations — the output of an artificial neuron is a continuous number. Biological neurons, conversely ..."
