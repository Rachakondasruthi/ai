title: "A perspective on the study of artificial and biological neural networks"
excerpt: "In recent years, researchers have been developing advanced computational techniques based on artificial neural networks, which are architectures inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain. Models based on artificial neural networks are trained to optimize millions of synaptic weights over millions of observations in order to make ..."
