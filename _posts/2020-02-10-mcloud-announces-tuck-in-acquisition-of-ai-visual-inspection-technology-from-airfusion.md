    excerpt: "In many computer vision systems the goal is to detect when something out of the ordinary has occurred: the anomaly. Often, we do not know in advance what the anomalous image will look like and it may be impossible to obtain image data that can represent all of the anomalies that we wish to detect. This lack of suitable data rules out ..."
