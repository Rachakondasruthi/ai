  - title: "Scientists make artificial and biological neurons communicate over the internet"
    excerpt: "But scientists in the U.K., Switzerland, Germany, and Italy are here to remind you that it really isn’t. In a recent experiment, the researchers fired up a working neural network that let biological and silicon-based artificial brain cells communicate with one another over an internet connection. At present, it’s still early stages for the ..."
