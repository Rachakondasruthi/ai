    excerpt: "ANML scales catastrophic forgetting reduction to a deep learning model with 6 million parameters. It also expands upon OML, a model that was introduced by Martha White and Khurram Javed at NeurIPS 2019 and is capable of completing up to 200 tasks without catastrophic forgetting. But Clune said ANML differs from OML because his team realized ..."
