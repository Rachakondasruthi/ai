title: "From models of galaxies to atoms, simple AI shortcuts speed up simulations by billions of times"
excerpt: "Emulators, algorithms that quickly approximate these detailed simulations, offer a shortcut. Now, work posted online shows how artificial intelligence (AI) can easily produce accurate emulators that can accelerate simulations across all of science by billions of times. “This is a big deal,” says Donald Lucas, who runs climate simulations at ..."
