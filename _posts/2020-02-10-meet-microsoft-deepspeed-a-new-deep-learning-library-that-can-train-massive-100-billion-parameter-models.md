title: "Meet Microsoft DeepSpeed, a new deep learning library that can train massive 100-billion-parameter models"
excerpt: "Microsoft Research today announced DeepSpeed, a new deep learning optimization library that can train massive 100-billion-parameter models. In AI, you need to have larger natural language models for better accuracy. But training larger natural language models is time consuming and the costs associated with it are very high. Microsoft claims ..."
