title: "Locating induced earthquakes with a network of seismic stations in Oklahoma via a deep learning method"
excerpt: "We observed that the large location errors are mainly in the areas without many training samples. The deep learning method requires training data, which means a newly installed network cannot apply the method with cataloged events. For a monitoring system that has been already trained for a seismic network, a couple of malfunction traces do not ..."
