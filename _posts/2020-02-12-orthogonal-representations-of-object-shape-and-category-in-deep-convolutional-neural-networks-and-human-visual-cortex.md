title: "Orthogonal Representations of Object Shape and Category in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Human Visual Cortex"
excerpt: "In conclusion, despite shape and category often being confounded in natural images, and the possibility for artificial neural networks to exploit this correlation when performing classification tasks, we find that deep convolutional neural networks are able to represent category information independently from low-level shape in a manner similar ..."

    excerpt: "In many computer vision systems the goal is to detect when something out of the ordinary has occurred: the anomaly. Often, we do not know in advance what the anomalous image will look like and it may be impossible to obtain image data that can represent all of the anomalies that we wish to detect. This lack of suitable data rules out ..."
