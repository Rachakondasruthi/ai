title: "Met Police's controversial facial recognition cameras correctly identify just one in three women"
excerpt: "Controversial facial recognition cameras used by Britain's biggest police force correctly identify only a third of women, an official report admits. A review of the technology by Scotland Yard also reveals that two in three men are accurately identified, while black people are far more likely to be wrongly flagged up than white people."
