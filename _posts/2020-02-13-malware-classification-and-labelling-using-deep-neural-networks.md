  - title: "Deep Learning with Spiking Networks: Optimising Energy Consumption"
    excerpt: "There are several important differences between what is nowadays known as a “neural network” (in the deep learning sense) and networks of neurons in the brain. A particularly evident one is that artificial networks have analogue activations — the output of an artificial neuron is a continuous number. Biological neurons, conversely ..."

    excerpt: "Therefore, in order to investigate their association, we applied a machine learning based dimensionality reduction technique, autoencoder, to generalize one single marker to represent chronic conditions. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Gansu Province of China. Random stratified sampling was adopted to include participants who were ..."

    excerpt: "Fortunately, machine learning (ML) is suitable for decreasing complexity in codeword selection, because ML could extract features from the data samples acquired in real environments. In this paper, we propose an ML approach to achieve an efficient and low complexity codeword selection for UAV networks. Specifically, we first derive the ..."
