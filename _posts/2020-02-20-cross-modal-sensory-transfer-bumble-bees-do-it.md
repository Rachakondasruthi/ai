title: "Cross-modal sensory transfer: Bumble bees do it"
excerpt: "Cross-modal recognition is also useful for increasing the flexibility of object-recognition systems. The finding by Solvi et al. illustrates that tiny invertebrates, with brain structures that differ greatly from those of vertebrates, also can experience an object with one sensory modality and later recognize that same object with a different ..."

  - title: "Bumble bees display cross-modal object recognition between visual and tactile senses"
    excerpt: "For example, an object out of view, but for which we have a mental image, can still be recognized by touch. Such cross-modal recognition is highly adaptive and has been recently identified in other mammals, but whether it is widespread has been debated."

  - title: "Bumble Bees Can Recognize Objects Across Senses"
    excerpt: "This ability to experience an object in one sensory modality and later recognize it in another is called cross-modal object recognition. It’s actually a highly complex cognitive capacity that was thought to be limited to vertebrates. Cross-modal object recognition has been demonstrated across vision and touch in humans, apes, monkeys ..."

  - title: "Bumblebees recognize objects through sight and touch, a complex cognitive feat"
    excerpt: "While cross-modal object recognition was previously thought to be a highly complex cognitive capacity capable by few animals outside humans, the results suggest that the bumblebee - with a brain with fewer than one million neurons - can create mental ..."
