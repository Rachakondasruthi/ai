title: "In black and white: Counting penguins gets easier with AI, computer vision"
excerpt: "Antarctica’s immensely popular penguins, whose numbers are declining alarmingly, could soon count on artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision to come to their rescue. Microsoft, Intel and Hyderabad-based start-up Gramener are harnessing the power of AI in counting Penguin populations on the icy continent faster and more accurately."
