title: "Police warned not to adopt ‘unjustifiable’ live facial recognition technology"
excerpt: "MSPs have warned Police Scotland not to use live facial recognition software as it is “not fit” for purpose and would be a “radical departure” from policing by consent. In a scathing report, Holyrood’s policing committee said the current technology discriminated against women and ethnic minorities and would be “unjustifiable”."
