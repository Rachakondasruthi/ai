title: "Will we really see delivery robots invading our sidewalks this decade?"
excerpt: "By 2019, Starship already claimed that its fleet had made 25,000 deliveries and traveled 93,000 kilometers. These electric robots work thanks to artificial intelligence and a learning system. Equipped with sensors that allow them to move along sidewalks and around obstacles, they also know how to cross streets and climb small slopes."
