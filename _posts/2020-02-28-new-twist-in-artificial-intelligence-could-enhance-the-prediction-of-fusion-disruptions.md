title: "New twist in artificial intelligence could enhance the prediction of fusion disruptions"
excerpt: "The method enables the deep learning form of AI machine learning to predict disruptions directly from raw ... These outcomes can be anything from language translation, to facial recognition, to disruptions of fusion plasma. Learning kicks in through \"back-propagation\" when predictions go awry. \"The error is fed back through the layers to ..."
