    excerpt: "We decided to use Deep Learning with TensorFlow by setting up a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify these images. It was necessary to have a large data set with training data for each page. Instead of taking many different pictures (which would have been very time consuming), we decided to make a video of each page and then take ..."
