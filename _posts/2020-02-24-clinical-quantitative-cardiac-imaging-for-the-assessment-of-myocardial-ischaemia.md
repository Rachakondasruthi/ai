title: "Clinical quantitative cardiac imaging for the assessment of myocardial ischaemia"
excerpt: "Of note, no studies have compared outcomes when therapy is decided on the basis of SPECT versus an alternative test ... blood velocity as a semiquantitative measure of myocardial ischaemia with improved image quality. Artificial intelligence solutions using machine learning for automated myocardial segmentation promise automated and fast ..."
