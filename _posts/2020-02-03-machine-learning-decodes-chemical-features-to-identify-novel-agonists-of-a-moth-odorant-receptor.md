title: "Machine learning decodes chemical features to identify novel agonists of a moth odorant receptor"
excerpt: "Although they determine the odor space of a given species, their functional characterization is a long process and remains limited. To date, machine learning virtual screening has been used to predict new ligands for such receptors in both mammals and insects, using chemical features of known ligands. In insects, such approach is yet limited to ..."
