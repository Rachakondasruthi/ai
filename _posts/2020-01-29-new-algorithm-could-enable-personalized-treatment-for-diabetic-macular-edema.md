title: "New Algorithm Could Enable Personalized Treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema"
excerpt: "The algorithm could also be adapted to predict therapy response for many other eye diseases, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The team’s algorithm is based on an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, a kind of artificial intelligence with the ability to investigate images by giving importance to a ..."
