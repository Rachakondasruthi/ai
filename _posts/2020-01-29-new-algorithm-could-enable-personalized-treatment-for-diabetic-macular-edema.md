title: "New Algorithm Could Enable Personalized Treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema"
excerpt: "The algorithm could also be adapted to predict therapy response for many other eye diseases, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The team’s algorithm is based on an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, a kind of artificial intelligence with the ability to investigate images by giving importance to a ..."

  - title: "New AI could predict outcome of diabetes-related vision loss"
    excerpt: "In a new study, researchers found that using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze retinal images could one day help doctors ... Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are widely used as the first line of therapy for diabetic macular edema, but they don’t work for everyone. There’s a need to identify who would benefit ..."

  - title: "Personality-Assisted Multi-Task Learning for Generic and Personalized Image Aesthetics Assessment"
    excerpt: "As an important subjective trait, personality is believed to be a key factor in modeling individual’s subjective preference. In this paper, we present a personality-assisted multi-task deep learning framework for both generic and personalized image aesthetics assessment. The proposed framework comprises two stages. In the first stage ..."
