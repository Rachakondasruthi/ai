title: "Using machine learning to find new antibiotics"
excerpt: "But in a paper publishing February 20 in the journal Cell, researchers demonstrate a method to uncover new antibiotics quickly and efficiently through machine learning. James Collins, a synthetic biologist at MIT, and his team trained a deep neural network to identify possible antibiotic molecules using compounds known to suppress E."

  - title: "Deep learning AI discovers surprising new antibiotics"
    excerpt: "Enter deep learning. These algorithms power many of today’s facial recognition systems and self-driving cars. They mimic how neurons in our brains operate by learning patterns in data. An individual artificial neuron – like a mini sensor – might detect simple patterns like lines or circles. By using thousands of these artificial neurons ..."
