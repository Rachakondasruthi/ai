title: "Snow and Ice Pose a Vexing Obstacle for Self-Driving Cars"
excerpt: "In late 2018, Krzysztof Czarnecki, a professor at Canada’s University of Waterloo, built a self-driving car and trained it to navigate surrounding neighborhoods with an annotated driving data set from researchers in Germany. The vehicle worked well enough to begin with, recognizing Canadian cars and pedestrians just as well as German ones."

    excerpt: "Interacting with a future self-driving car could be a lot like working with some future interpretation of Apple iOS with voice, gesture and touch-enabled commands at your disposal. It's the overarching view gathered after reading through an Apple patent application filed last August and published last week for a self-driving car voice and ..."
