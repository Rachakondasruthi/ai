title: "Are Robots Better Investors Than Humans?"
excerpt: "Would you entrust your money to an artificial intelligence? On one hand, that could seem like stacking risk atop risk. On the other hand, it’s unlikely that a robot would suddenly develop Bernie Madoff-ish tendencies and begin defrauding investors. If nothing else, we’re pretty sure the Three Laws of Robotics prevent financial misdeeds."
