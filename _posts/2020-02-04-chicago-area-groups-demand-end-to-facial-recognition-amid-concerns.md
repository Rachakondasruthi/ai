    excerpt: "At the heart of this development is something called live facial recognition (LFR), software which can automatically recognise a face in a crowd within a fraction of a second. And this means we can be monitored everywhere we go, no matter who we are with or what we are doing. Facial recognition could strike at the very core of our free society."
