title: "New algorithm for self-driving vehicles has a bold ‘collision-free guarantee’"
excerpt: "Researchers have developed an algorithm that could stop self-driving vehicles from getting in crashes and traffic jams. The team from Northwestern University (NU) claims their invention is “the first decentralized algorithm with a collision-free, deadlock-free guarantee.” The algorithm divides the ground beneath the machines into a grid."

    excerpt: "Researchers have developed a novel algorithm that may allow collision-free transportation in autonomous vehicles, an advance which they claim can help self-driving cars navigate each other without crashing, or causing traffic jams.The study, published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Robotics, tested the algorithm in a simulation of 1,024 ..."
