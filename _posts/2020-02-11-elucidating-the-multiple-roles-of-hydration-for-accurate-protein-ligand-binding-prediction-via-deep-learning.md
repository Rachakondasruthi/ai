title: "Elucidating the multiple roles of hydration for accurate protein-ligand binding prediction via deep learning"
excerpt: "Nevertheless, for 16% of all systems this near-native pose could not be ranked first by the deep-learning model. Furthermore, for about 150 systems, which failed in the top rank but had a near-native pose at the second rank, the CNN score was almost identical. Further analysis revealed four main reasons for this difficulty in reproducing the ..."
